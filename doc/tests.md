# Automated Tests for Bob's Jobs

Part of the grading for this assignmnet will be based on automated test
using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).  These test check the formal
requirements for each level.  You will get the assigned marks if your
code passes the tests.

Cypress tests are _end to end_ tests in that they test the behaviour of
your application in the browser.  The tests make requests and interact with
your application, clicking on links and checking the content of the pages. 

You should be able to install Cypress by running the flowing command from
the main project folder:

```shell
npm install
```
